## Hospitals Do Not Have a Right to Pilfer Consumers

Accredited private and public hospitals provide ***essential services to the public at large,*** wherein the patient’s life and limb are at stake. Healthcare providers do so, while impacting public health as well as public healthcare policies. Such hospitals and clinics therefore exist within the purview of public facing entities, that have a fiduciary duty towards the Consumer as well as a civic duty towards the public at large, for maintaining ***equality in standards*** of healthcare goods and services provided to the public. Furthermore, such duties and responsibilities belonging to healthcare providers are to be necessarily fulfilled without deficiencies, delinquencies, or discriminatory prejudices pertaining to class, creed, religion, language, gender, age, region, physical or mental handicap, or any other categorical factors involved in discriminatory practices.

The fiduciary and civic duties of such public facing healthcare organizations includes the responsibility of the healthcare provider to ***make equality in healthcare accessible and affordable,*** to the communities, districts, states, and the national or international regions they choose to serve. Most importantly, they must carry forth their oath and honour-bound duties, without gouging or frustrating any Consumers i.e. members of the general public. 

Hospitals are neither lodges, hostels, hotels, nor motels, because the prevalent risk to the patient in a clinical setting, from a potential loss of life or limb, necessitates that the business operations and trade practices of all accredited healthcare providers be above board, compassionate, and in good-faith, at all times. Healthcare services are never to be sold under the guise of “hospitality” by using trickery or treachery, or any type of false advertisements, because of the dangers posed to public health and safety arising from any professional misconduct or erroneous actions of healthcare providers, that can potentially cause irreparable damages to Consumers.  

Now, in the context of Indian Consumers, the public enterprise known as Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) only impacts the *class and category of people* in the Republic of India who are employees or retirees of the Central Government. Therefore, any healthcare organization that is currently, deliberately denying CGHS to Indian residents, is undoubtedly discriminating against this specific class and category of people, in a targeted and prejudiced manner, regardless of the healthcare provider’s pretexts to do so.  

As such, it has been observed that there are certain hospital chains and groups that have been willingly and knowingly acting as aggressors against Government of India’s employees and retirees, using dubious trade practices. Those dubious trade practices against Consumers have included acts of cheating, scamming, theft, use of false advertisements, abduction, wrongful confinement, extortion, and blackmail for profiteering. Such types of vile, insidious, thuggish, pernicious, tortuous, and <ins>treasonous</ins> actions have been deliberately aimed at degrading or destabilizing the economic as well as physical well being of, Indian citizens and residents. Collected and available evidences demonstrate the manner in which a certain hospital group has covertly conducted such offensive actions against the State of Telangana, and the Republic of India, using the guise of being a “reputable Private Corporation in the Healthcare Industry.” 

It must also be noted that, such ongoing acts of treachery and treason are being conducted against Indian citizens through the use of instruments, investments, business insurance, managerial instructions, consulting advice, and material support from national as well as *foreign multinational trade groups and business affiliates.* 

So, forthright and swift legal actions need to be taken immediately by concerned authorities, to crack down upon such offensive and culpable organizations, particularly for their syndicated crimes, with suitable award of compensation and punitive damages being given by the state, to persons injured or harmed by those organized criminals.
