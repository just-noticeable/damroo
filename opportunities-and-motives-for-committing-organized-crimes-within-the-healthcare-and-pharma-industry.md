## Opportunities and Motives for Committing Organized Crimes within The Healthcare and Pharmaceutical Industry

It needs to be noted that, all goods and services sold to inpatients by a healthcare provider are by default, postpaid goods and services. 

Next, it can be observed that, many hospitals in Telangana, India, have been cleverly positioning and labeling the postpaid goods and services given to inpatients as, "pay-on-delivery." Through such dishonesty, those hospital managers and medical practitioners are able to circumvent mandatory norms and requirements for providing proper invoices to customers. Such activities are being done by identifiable hospital managers and medical practitioners for their evident purposes and motives of, amassing unearned incomes via profiteering.  

The proof of this type of professional malfeasance and malpractice is evidenced in the fact that, all such healthcare providers financially recognize the rendered medical goods and services within their accounting systems, at the particular date-and-time when those commercial goods and services get consumed while treating inpatients. But then, days or weeks later, around the time of the patient's discharge, the hospital management gives a so-called Proforma Bill or a Provisional Bill, to the Party paying for those retailed goods and services, under the pretenses of pay-on-delivery. Furthermore, tens of hours or sometimes multiple days can then pass by, after that Provisional Bill is discussed by the involved Parties, and subsequently processed by the healthcare provider for generating a so-called Final Bill, again, while using the disguise of pay-on-delivery as per that financial instrument. The Final Bill, is similarly given to the paying Party, without any terms and conditions of a proper commercial invoice saliently printed on that financial instrument. This is how, rendered goods and services of a hospital or a clinic, that were already delivered and consumed, days or weeks earlier, become disguised as being delivered on the Final Bill's date. 

Finally it can be seen that, by conducting this type of a dishonest trade practice, a hospital can more conveniently manipulate and force the Consumer into paying its hiked fees and inflated bills, while using the confined inpatient as a piece of collateral property to compel the patient's family to cave into paying, the non-invoiced or improperly invoiced bills. This is why it can be said that, those medical goods and services were never "rendered in good-faith" by those types of offensive hospitals and clinics.  

The prevalent injustice of habitually and criminally breaching Consumer Trust, of systematically cheating baited members from the public, of price gouging, and of forcing those targeted victims to pay a ransom under duress to secure the release of the inpatient (or the dead body) from a hospital, becomes conveniently hidden and cast aside. This is particularly a problematic issue during legal battles about "unfairness" of such cunningly organized activities being orchestrated by willful wrongdoers, because the corporate lawyers of bad hospitals and clinics, and even members of law enforcement agencies, divert the aggrieved victims to judiciary bodies that do not have the proper jurisdiction to adjudicate such of criminal justice. The aggrieved victims then suffer attrition and worse insults to injuries, at the hands of state-sponsored judiciary bodies that are not capable of adjudicating such punishable offenses being committed by trained business managers and registered medical practitioners. 

Worst of all, these endemic issues are still prevalent in India because, neither the legislature, nor the judiciary, nor the medical fraternity are diligently taking the necessary steps to crack down upon, and curtail, such types of organized crimes that are being conducted openly in broad daylight, by a number of rich and politically influential corporate bosses of healthcare managers and medical practitioners, against selectively targeted communities of people belonging to religious or ethnic minority groups.

"The boat" is already sinking in the middle of the ocean while having been surrounded by sharks, with its rudder and mast broken, with gaping holes in its hull, and that too without any oars. Though we are still together in this boat called Telangana, at least, there is no more an issue about rocking or not rocking the boat.
