<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This article highlights a foundational security vulnerability in India's nation-wide financial and defense systems, that isn't yet, an emergency.</p>
<p>To understand how and why the current version of ECHS is a national-security vulnerability for India, we can first have a look at the case of LifeLabs in Canada from the year 2017-2019.</p> 
<p>And, no, this is not seditious, please don't read this with the mindset of a person who is still aping the erstwhile British Raj.</p>
<p>This matter is being respectfully presented to you, so that you may understand that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a war is not about to reach India's shores, because a Full-Spectrum-War has already engulfed South Asia, due to AUKUS.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="canadian-lifelabs-case">Canadian LifeLabs Case</h3>
<p>A nation's healthcare data reveals the following two vital indices for national security strategies:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Number of people whose age has currently become, or will soon become eligible for military service in the coming two or three years.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Portion of national population that is currently fit for military service, if a conscription or a levy were to be implemented.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Analysis of the leaked <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/lifelabs-data-breach-report-1.7393107">LifeLabs data</a> showed that Canada's situation in the year December-2019, as per the above two indices, was worse than that of Germany, for military preparedness. Which is why, NATO's ongoing imperialist war with Russia and China has become a tragedy for Bosnia, Ukraine, West Africa, Libya, Sudan, Palestine, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Afghanistan. In each of those countries, NATO has not been able to put sufficiently many boots on the ground, to propagate their imperialist designs against China and Russia. That tragedy is about to spill over into Greenland, Brazil, Iran, and Turkey, as well as South and South East Asia, because of the escalations of &quot;trade-wars&quot; and &quot;cyber-wars&quot; between international geopolitical blocs, currently occurring in the Arctic Circle, Central America, Colombia, Venezuela, Djibouti, Straights of Malacca, and in the Chinese region of Taiwan.</p>
<p>For a deeper understanding of what had happened and is happening with NATO, and what tends to happen when centralized healthcare systems of a country get hacked, please have a look at this article - <a href="https://github.com/callthis/editorial/blob/main/docs/02-4-1.md"><strong>&quot;Call This Editorial - 2.4.1 Culpability of Key Public and Private organizations in Canada&quot;</strong></a></p>

<h3 id="indian-echs-case">Indian ECHS Case</h3>
<p>So, will <a href="https://github.com/just-noticeable/damroo/blob/main/a-closer-look-at-cghs.md">this piece of knowledge</a>, about how ECHS is as dysfunctional as CGHS, upon reaching a wider audience in the Indian public, undermine the public's trust in its armed services? From my point of view, I do not think that this will undermine the services or the trust people have in the armed forces.<a id="fnref:1" href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The public in most countries of the world already expects government based initiatives as being poorly implemented, shoddily managed, or completely rigged with corruption. We are yet to become a Singapore or a Switzerland, to expect our government initiatives in India to have &quot;impeccable quality of service&quot;, because we are realists who know that we ought to consider ourselves as being &quot;blessed&quot;, if we ever manage to get any public amenities that are bare minimum decent, clean, and minimally legitimate. Expecting complete legitimacy and efficient functionality of a public utility among Indian cities, is still, only a day-dream.</p>
<p>So, the more valuable and appreciable thing for the current Indian Government to do, for earning the public's trust and increasing the public's confidence in the armed forces, will be to have the military chiefs acknowledge the faults of ECHS, and to then showcase the process of repairing it by having ECHS merge with CGHS. Then, by naming the merged entity as CGHS, it will be much more meaningful to have employees and retirees of the armed forces finally be served properly for all of their healthcare needs, alongside civilian members of Indian Government Employers. Doing this would also help in the merged public fund called CGHS, to become stronger and robust, and to become compliant with IRDAI regulations, by having selected military personnel working in CGHS as managers.</p>
<p>This type of a merger that produces a better CGHS for India as a whole, would make more sense from the perspective of every Indian household and family in which a person is a member of the armed forces, and their spouse or other family members, happen to be a member of a civilian government agency. This is so that, they and their dependents in the household, would not need to think about which program (either CGHS or ECHS) would be a better option, for their household's healthcare needs, particularly if India were to have a properly functioning public enterprise called CGHS as a health insurance provider.</p>
<p>Also, currently, the Directorate of ECHS relies on the Directorate of CGHS to create the list of CGHS Empanelled Hospitals across India, that can be accredited as ECHS approved healthcare providers. Corporate hospitals and private clinics in India known as CGHS Empanelled Hospitals, that invariably also get accredited as ECHS Empanelled Hospitals, typically don't have to go through a process that is significantly different, in becoming an accredited hospital for either CGHS or ECHS.</p>
<p>The Directorate of CGHS in turn, relies on NABH to conduct inspections in those accredited hospitals and clinics to make sure that they are compliant with CGHS rules and regulations, for maintaining national standards in healthcare services. However, the existing NABH standards are bellow the ones prescribed by ISO for healthcare providers. And, the NABH has till date, only shown itself to be soft on bad-actors within the healthcare industry. The NABH in essence, has created a nation-wide culture, of allowing poor accounting systems and sub-standard practices to be used among those hospitals and clinics that are already accredited as CGHS/ECHS Empanelled Hospitals.</p>
<p>More importantly, in order to hide the faults of ECHS and CGHS from the public's eye, although hoodwinking Indian citizens could be possible for a few more months, or perhaps, even for another year, it is already impossible to make excuses in front of international underwriters and investors about the current state of affairs in India's healthcare industry. Those international underwriters and investors are able to see the manner in which both CGHS and ECHS have been causing a loss to them, in the scale of millions of Euros per year, from bad investments in markets for ETFs that have a component of any Indian PSU.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every Indian PSU has been negatively impacted and is still being harmed by the glaring flaws within CGHS and ECHS, because of which, investments into markets for ETFs that are tied to Indian PSUs is presently a huge risk, for international brokerages and banks. This is how Indian PSUs impact India's national security and Defence budgeting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, a range of persistent and parasitic cyber-attacks from para-military forces of Western Alliances, have already shredded the stock market value of various Indian PSUs in the energy, minerals, and automotive sectors. Those cyber-attacks and &quot;trade wars&quot; against Asia will only continue to take advantage of the foundational flaws, within the fiscal systems of inter-connected Indian Government Employers, to knock down India's overall economic growth. Those trade wars are indeed aimed at pushing India and the entirety of Asia, towards a lower standing, within the so-called &quot;International 'Rules Based' Order.&quot;</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to protect the nation's integrity and sovereignty, it is the responsibility of the Indian armed forces to strengthen and fortify each aspect of its logistics and human resources systems that are tied to the Indian economy. However, I can imagine a few high ranking officers who will cajole and cox themselves into believing that all is well with the ECHS, merely to save their career. But, putting their career ahead of the nation's security, and prioritizing their pecuniary interests above the nation's sovereignty, is only going to cause grave hardships to fall upon all Indian citizens and residents.<a id="fnref:2" href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>India's national equity that resides within the physical health and productivity of our citizens, is inseparably linked to India's standing and status within the international geopolitical arena. India's competitiveness and economic growth, depends squarely on the educational and creative capacities of its diverse peoples. Also, all modes of international travel and logistics impacting the Indian diaspora, are dependent on the Indian government's ability to make good on its promissory notes and treasury bonds for financing its international debts, without hindering open market trade regulations via designs of its public sector programs such as CGHS and ECHS. For these reasons, Indian merchants and corporations will continue to get derided and penalized at IBS, if the Indian government continues to use anti-competition tactics through the current designs of CGHS and ECHS, against international underwriters and insurers.</p>
<p>Therefore, practically the only remaining viable option and course of action is to merge ECHS with CGHS, name the merged entity CGHS, and then reconstitute its basic functions to provide health insurance to all Central Government employees and retirees, and to their dependents, throughout India. Such a mandate would need to be implemented by providing each subscribing individual, a proper policy document for a CGHS credit card, that would be exclusively usable for healthcare expenses in CGHS accredited hospitals. Keeping CGHS and ECHS separate, for the sake of redundancy or for allowing a separation of data pertaining to military personnel from medical data of civilians belonging to the general public, will be a waste of resources through duplication of efforts.</p>
<p>Thereafter, protecting that centralized database of healthcare data belonging to millions of individual Indian citizens, from cyber-attacks, and ensuring that the operations of the reconstituted CGHS do not interfere with each citizen's Consumer choice to utilize private health insurance products, will be crucial to improving the nation's human resources towards better economic growth.</p>
<p>Now, it does appear as though a number of Indian government officials who have been cheating armed forces personnel through programs like ECHS, have been cajoling themselves with the idea that, if soldiers can willingly sacrifice their lives for the improvement of the nation, then those soldiers can certainly sacrifice their emoluments and retirement benefits, for the improvement of the personal comforts of a few politicians. However, those politicians forgot that none of the soldiers in any country are willing to sacrifice the health and well being of their beloved friends and family members, for covering up the apparent corruption and incompetence prevalent in various government programs of their nation, especially to cover up the greed and selfishness of a few bureaucratic officials. Not only soldiers, but all conscientious human beings already know that there isn't any form of &quot;greater good and peace&quot; that can emerge from willful ignorance, and especially from ignorance that propagates corruption.</p>
<p>So, what's my interest in any of this? All that you need to know about me is that I can only serve The Truth and nothing else.</p>

<p>Now, throughout India, and pertaining to ECHS, &quot;When the soldiers who realize that they along with hundreds of thousands of other armed forces staff have been cheated badly, by few higher ups from among their own, and that their nearest and dearest family members were also grievously harmed by their own government, will those soldiers then become demoralized? Or worse, become so angry that they will resort to mutiny?&quot; No. Soldiers have already withstood and endured much worse betrayals and harms, because of various factors and historical reasons involving our government's leadership. And over time, many of those factors and reasons have been mended or resolved, by those very soldiers who had been injured. They were able to do so, in order to improve the lives of all current and future members of the armed forces, by starting with a clear understanding of how those injurious, destructive, unjust, and harmful outcomes from government schemes had come into existence in the first place.<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-back-ref">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>Also, would any of the officers and their underlings whose careers might become shortened, because of their mismanagement of ECHS, want to belittle me as a &quot;snitch&quot; or a &quot;troll&quot;, or hurt me using covert methods, or wound me fatally? I'm sure, they could. I mean, why not? But it is much more likely that they will instead work on figuring out how to keep their careers and pensions intact, by accepting responsibility and repairing ECHS, in the best way possible. So, if any persons would like to blame me, or ascribe faults to my character or conduct, for revealing these details about ECHS, then let those persons firstly explain the nature of that blame or fault, to the Visa or Mastercard companies. Those private credit card companies don't even care about the retaliatory capabilities of the American and the Chinese military agencies when it comes to recovering debt owed to them from those state-sponsored agencies, because organizations like the IBS, IMF, WHO, WTO, and Visa and Mastercard, are practically untouchable by national level governments. As such, do you suppose those private companies that govern international trade and globalization, in the name of &quot;International 'Rules Based' Order&quot;, would care to put up with anti-competition tactics being used by the Indian government against international underwriters and insurers? Those governing organizations of the so-called &quot;New World Order&quot; are going to do to India in the coming year, the same types of things they had done to Japan in the nineteen-eighties.<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-back-ref">&#8617;</a></p>
