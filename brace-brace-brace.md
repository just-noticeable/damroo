## Brace! Brace! Brace! 

>Various unregulated Cash Advance Programs (CAPs) belonging to Government of India, give out daily and monthly financial credit and insurance for healthcare expenses, to millions of employees and retirees of the Central Government throughout India. It's now too late for them to course-correct, and not crash into the ground.

>Will it actually matter to any bureaucrats working for a CAPs in a government office, if the irregularities and inefficiencies in their work continues to cause injuries and damages to millions of people in India? Maybe, maybe not. Will most of the top officials incharge of those CAPs feign indignation by saying that such an article is defamatory, while continuing to deny their responsibilities and being derelict at their duties because of their lack of motivation to resolve such critical issues? Most probably yes. But at the end of the day, many of those office workers in each CAPs will have the excuse to say that it is somebody else's job, to fix the rules and procedures of their institution, or to redesign their work for making it regularized and efficient.


Let us firstly pinpoint the cause of the crash: 

- Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) and Ex-Servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS) as well as all other such healthcare programs or schemes operated by various Ministries of the Government of India (GoI), derive monthly premium contributions from the salaries and pensions of all employees and retirees of the GoI. 
	This has been ongoing for more than a decade and is still being done, so as to provide ***"Cash Advance"*** and health insurance guarantees, to those tens of millions of individuals and their dependents, for daily and monthly healthcare expenses. That form of unregulated health insurance coverage is provided to those currently retired or employed individuals, ***without any policy document about the type of credit or insurance*** given to the Consumer, by each of those Cash Advance Programs (CAPs) operated by the GoI. 
	
	The CAPs provide credit and insurance to healthcare Consumers, through selected and commercially partnered retail channels, which are the "within-network" private healthcare organizations called, "Empanelled Hospitals." This type of irregular credit and unregulated insurance is provided by such CAPs, to millions of Consumers in India, without transparently specifying the amount of the yearly insurance premium, the deductible, the terms of benefits, and the terms of co-pay as well as co-insurance for each individual, through a policy offer given to, and a policy document transacted with, the individuals qualified for utilizing those government operated health insurance and credit programs. 

The above-mentioned cause is the main one, but the uncontrolled and active catalyst, which has propelled the CAPs towards a crash is the fact that: 

- Annuities directly deposited into the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) through a portion of tax-deducted salaries and pensions of all Central Government employees and retirees, that are appropriated into respective CAPs, accrue interests at the RBI, and are also invested into publicly traded shares of Central Government owned corporate entities called Public Sector Units (PSUs). Government employees and retirees happen to be members and essential workers of those PSUs who utilize either of those CAPs. 

	The greater the inefficiency or delay and corruption, involved in processing a medical expense claim submitted by those essential workers through any given CAPs, the greater the amount of financial interests on those annuities that becomes unaccounted for, by the Central Government, due to the basic lack of transparency within fiscal records of each CAPs furnished by respective Ministries and PSUs. 
	
	By depriving its employees and retirees of proper healthcare insurance and timely medical cost reimbursements, the Central Government pads its various financial accounts using black-boxed accounting methods and undisclosed interest rates on those annuities and equity, at the RBI.   

However, the above type of mismanagement would simply be known as a mishap due to gross negligence, if it weren't for the following fact that makes certain aspects of each CAPs, a daily violation of Consumer Rights of millions of individuals in India: 

- Particularly the CAPs operated via the University Grants Commission (UGC) of the Ministry of Education, illegally prevents students, employees, and retirees of Central Universities, and their dependents, from purchasing regulated and proper health insurance policies from the open market. The members of India's Central Universities are forced to pay into a CGHS-like CAP without a choice; and are not allowed to utilize the actual CGHS operated by the *Directorate of CGHS* under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. 

	Worst of all, members of India's Central Universities and their dependents are also forced to sign an undertaking stating that they have not utilized a policy from any private or public health insurance company, in part or in whole, while submitting Medical Reimbursement Claims (MRCs) to a Central University's CAP.  

Combination of the above-mentioned facts constitute a systemic vulnerability within India's banking and insurance systems, specifically because: 

- RBI's Savings Bonds are tied to the performance of those interdependent PSUs and CAPs, while having numerous retail banking products and other financial derivatives in the open markets also pegged to the annual yield of the RBI's Savings Bonds. 

	- However, creating a true buffer or a strong safety mechanism to reduce the impact of the systemic shock that could propagate as a chain-reaction in India's open financial markets, from the divestment in, or the short-selling of those largely exposed financial products by investors, may or may not be feasible at this point in time. 

- The undeniable and unchecked hemorrhage of tax-payer monies, caused by multiplication of redundant efforts and bureaucracies for CGHS, through its unofficial and unregulated versions operated by various Ministries of the GoI, cannot be immediately cauterized and remedied. 

	- The copycat versions of CGHS being operated as a CAP, at "Autonomous Institutes and Entities belonging to the GoI", must be eliminated by being absorbed into the actual CGHS to ensure uniformity, and to save costs to the tax-payer as well as the Central Government. However, that cannot be done so readily at this point in time. 
	
	- Each proper and official CAPs under a Government Directorate, upon being regulated as a legitimate insurance company *(and as a credit card company)*, must then be reconstituted to digitally interface directly with Empanelled Hospitals, to clear the invoiced payments of medical costs for qualified Consumers who use a CGHS *(Credit)* Card for payments at those healthcare providers. 
	
		This would make the settlement of MRCs largely automated via digitization, with accurate cross-referencing by regulated health insurance providers for security and fraud prevention. But such a necessary systemic overhaul, cannot be implemented readily, at this point in time.   

- A number of healthcare providers among the Empanelled Hospitals, have continued to exploit and abuse the CAPs by denying qualified individuals healthcare credit via the respective CAPs. 

	- Rectifying the culpable behaviors of those healthcare providers cannot be readily implemented via legal actions taken by responsible and competent authorities, at this point in time. 
	
		The number of State Medical Councils and regulatory bodies complicit in allowing malpractices of certain corporate bosses of particular hospital chains in India, will involve years of litigation and courtroom drama, after the cover up of those malpractices, is completely and utterly blown away.

So naturally, tens of millions of healthcare Consumers in India who have good or excellent credit scores, as Central Government employees and retirees: 

- Supposedly gain no real healthcare insurance benefits from being *"Health Insurance Policy Holders"* via either of the CAPs, because a true and legally binding health insurance policy document, carried by qualified persons, is simply non-existent;

- Happen to loose significant sums of money each month as cash out-of-pocket for medical expenses, on top of their monthly mandatory contributions to a CAP; 

- Often suffer from getting referred to injurious and unscrupulous healthcare providers among Empanelled Hospitals; 

- Are unfairly prevented and unjustly prohibited, from purchasing a proper health insurance plan from the market; 

- And also end up giving actual credit to the inefficiencies of various CAPs via their Central Government based employers, so that the Ministry of Finance can do large-scale accounting wizardry with RBI's black-boxed accounts.

Upon investigation, one might find that a sixty-year-old government worker's mandatory contribution towards health insurance into a CAP, is in the order of Rs 6,000 to Rs 7,000 (six thousand to seven thousand Rupees) per month. That level of monthly contribution or Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) as an insurance premium, would have bought the Consumer the most comprehensive yearly health insurance benefits package, worth Rs 2 Crore (Rupees 20 Million), from any of the regularized private health insurance companies in India. More importantly, it would have allowed the Consumer to visit a doctor for healthcare needs in almost any of the hundreds of good corporate hospital networks across India, by using cashless payment at each medical visit, without any hassles for clearing the invoices or bills for those medical claims. 

Lastly, I wouldn't have published any of this online, if people like the employees of Hindenburg Research weren't trained to keep digging tirelessly for pay-dirt. Neither do they have the ability to give up when faced with a challenge, like some people working in government bureaucracies; nor do they have the ability to give in, when cajoled by lobbyists with gifts and bribes, like some other people working in government bureaucracies. Those maverick researchers and analysts, only have the ability to suit up, and gear up, and then let things go, like a long-ranged stealthy torpedo.
