## CGHS & ECHS are Rightfully a Component of Central Government's Basic-Pay

In fact, Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) and Ex-Servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS) <u>are not</u> "privileges" or "perks" offered to Central Govt workers and retirees in India, as those health insurance and basic benefits are a vital component of their basic-pay, wages, salaries, pensions, and emoluments. 

As per India's laws, legislated via the statue of *State Employees' Insurance Act, 1948,* Govt workers and retirees of postal, police, fire, defense, health, education, forestry, sports, and administrative departments have a mandatory requirement to be insured by The State's corporation for healthcare insurance, i.e. corporations such as CGHS and ECHS. Such category of current and ex-members of the Central Govt of India also include particular journalists, freedom fighters, and scholars. The basic compensations of those workers and pensioners via government's payroll services aren't a "perk" to be stolen or eroded by the whims of bad bureaucrats. 

>[!NOTE]  
>Especially with respect to *Section 1(4) of State Employees' Insurance Act, 1948,* that has been in effect since 1989, within all states and union territories of The Republic of India:
>
>The "healthcare expense reimbursement programs" being operated by various establishments belonging to or controlled via majority share holding by The State, are significantly dissimilar and largely deficient compared to the "cashless transactions" and nation-wide benefits of CGHS/ECHS. 
>
>For example, members of State Bank of India (SBI) are being forced to endure "cash-flow risks" and are being deprived of the opportunity to build Credit History, from having to use the healthcare expense reimbursement program of the said Public Sector Unit (PSU). As such, SBI's healthcare expense reimbursement program is *neither substantially similar nor superior to CGHS,* particularly because "CGHS is cashless based on a CGHS Card with an electronic chip" throughout India for each cadre of Govt workers and pensioners.  

Additionally, in the context of public institutes, it must be noted that: Vice Chancellors, Directors, and Registrars of the Govt's Higher Education Institutes are directly under the supervision of the Chancellor, i.e. the President of India. But, many of them who are still under the Govt's payrolls have declared their institute as a non-Central Govt Entity, and as "Autonomous." 

In this manner, by shamelessly and cunningly usurping sovereignty above the Central Govt's affairs, those executive officers of various and several Govt institutes have abused their "discretionary powers" for deliberately circumventing legislative controls and audits, in a belligerent act of treason and usurpation. 

As such, a pattern of corrupt behaviour openly exists among India's several Central Universities and Govt's Higher Education Institutes. This is mainly due to the intentional abuse of official powers by the executives of those Central Govt Entities, in abject violation of established laws and ordinances. 

Due to this type of rampant corruption, executive officers of University of Hyderabad (i.e. Hyderabad Central University, HCU) cunningly "auctioned and sold" hundreds of acres of public lands by destroying ecologically sensitive forests and wetlands. They did so, by willfully and knowingly entering into shady deals with private buyers, through the aid of State Govt bureaucrats who were an accessory to such organized crimes. Similar shady deals currently exist between HCU and healthcare organizations in Telangana. 

The Legislative Assembly and Judiciary Courts in India must observe that an Army Chief of Staff cannot arbitrarily remove a platoon or any other unit of the military from ECHS, by claiming autonomy to do so. Similarly, executive officers of "Autonomous Institutes" cannot arbitrarily remove their institute from CGHS, specifically because there has never been an explicitly stated provision to do so, in any legislative Act that governs those institutes. 

Likewise, Govt pleaders and advocates must note: *"the faults and deficiencies within healthcare benefits programs arising due to non-uniform private deals between PSUs and Public Institutes, with healthcare organizations, for reimbursement of healthcare expenses to The State's employees."* They should also take note of the yearly wastage of public money, and the encroachment upon the roles and responsibilities of the Director Generals of CGHS and ECHS, that is being committed by executive officers of PSUs and Public Institutes through irregular and non-uniform employee benefits programs.

Each of the so-called employee benefits programs that Govt Entities like Central Universities are operating, particularly by using the ruse of having autonomy, are highly irregular, discriminatory, and utterly arbitrary in how the members of those institutes are serviced by privately contracted healthcare organizations for discounted treatments or for "CGHS rates and tariffs", upon submitting a Medical Reimbursement Claim to the institute's officers. 

More importantly, what inducements did the executive officers of various Central Govt Organizations have, for removing their respective organizations from CGHS, only to then enter into private deals with corporate hospitals and clinics, for healthcare treatments at irregular discounts and *at outdated CGHS rates and tariffs?* Did they receive bribes and gifts from those corporate healthcare providers to push salary or pension earners, into the fangs of wolfs, especially those predatory wolfs who are disguised as managers of hospitals and private insurers?  

<br>

>[!IMPORTANT] 
>So, are institutes like Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and HCU, a private corporate entity? No. Do they or their campuses belong to the Telangana State Govt? No. Are they a non-government organization? No. 
> 
>Do entities like HCU, CSIR, and Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO) exist because of a Central Govt Legislative Act? Yes. Do they function primarily on public money from Govt of India? Yes. Do they file annual reports to the Rajya Sabha? Yes. Are they an agent of The State? Yes. So how are they not a Central Govt Entity? 
>
>They most certainly are a Central Govt Entity, and so are all Public Sector Units (PSUs) such as State Bank of India (SBI), Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) and Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL). This is a fact that cannot be denied or further belaboured.  
>
>Now, supposedly, organizations such as India's Central Universities and PSUs like HAL are "Autonomous Institutes" or "Semi-Autonomous Enterprises." But their so-called autonomy doesn't grant their officers any authority or powers that are independent of The Republic's laws, that too, while deriving legitimacy and funding from the Central Govt!

Also, "CGHS/ECHS Empanelled Healthcare Organizations" are accredited and heavily subsidized by The State, due to which, the managers and medical practitioners of those healthcare organizations have already been prepaid in good-faith via tax-payer money, along with a fair profit margin for their healthcare goods and services rendered as per CGHS/ECHS.

And yet, many healthcare organizations in India, while continuously maintaining their "CGHS/ECHS Empanellment" for receiving annual Govt subsidies (public monies), dishonestly claim that their staff and contractors go unpaid or underpaid, for rendering goods and services through CGHS/ECHS. Furthermore, numerous conniving staff and managers belonging to accredited hospitals in India, circumvent CGHS/ECHS norms by claiming that, one or the other medical goods or services are not covered under the said government scheme, when in fact those items are clearly listed in published government orders. 

Bad actors among healthcare organizations and colluding executives from so-called Autonomous Institutes are exploitatively taking undue advantage of the fact that, a majority of Central Govt members who are rightly entitled to CGHS/ECHS are unaware of relevant government orders and scheduled lists published within obscure parts of government websites, especially when that vital and relevant information is simply never displayed saliently in hospital websites and in their buildings where patients can learn about their rights. 

This profound failure in proper governance and administration of public funds and utilities, is still ongoing, mainly because mafia organization have taken root within the Healthcare and Pharmaceutical Industry sectors of many states in India. Worst of all, despite clear and open evidence of such publicly visible wrongdoings, policing agencies are hesitant, reluctant, or downright adamant about not taking full and appropriate legal actions against those identified wrongdoers, primarily because of complacency, incompetence, impotence, cowardice, and corruption that has become prevalent among particular groups of police officers. 

So, would law enforcement agencies such as the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) have the necessary resources, to mitigate or counteract advanced persistent threats from cyber-attacks and drone based attacks on police stations, courthouses, hospitals and other critical infrastructure in India? How will they, especially when they never received those crucial resources from Research and Development (R&D) institutes, particularly because workers in those government institutes, including those in CRPF and NIA along with their family members, are still being put under inordinate stresses and strain, and are also being thrust into jeopardy, from being habitually cheated by accredited and subsidized "CGHS/ECHS Empanelled Healthcare Organizations" like Quality Care India Ltd (i.e. Care Hospitals). 

No doubt, too many bad bureaucrats and public servants have been colluding with corporate healthcare organizations for profiteering at the expense of public good and public safety. Lawful and necessary punishments for curtailing and deterring their culpable activities of profiteering and racketeering are long-overdue.
