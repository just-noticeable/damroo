## CGHS & ECHS are Rightfully a Component of Central Government's Basic-Pay

In fact, Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) and Ex-Servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS) <u>are not</u> "privileges" or "perks" offered to Central Govt workers and retirees in India, as those health insurance and basic benefits are a vital component of their basic-pay, wages, salaries, pensions, and emoluments. 

As per India's laws, legislated via the statue of *State Employees' Insurance Act, 1948,* Govt workers and retirees of postal, police, fire, defense, health, education, and administrative departments have a mandatory requirement to be insured by The State's corporation for healthcare insurance, corporations such as CGHS and ECHS. The basic compensations of those workers and pensioners via government's payroll services aren't a "perk" to be stolen or eroded by the whims of bad bureaucrats. 

It must be noted that: Vice Chancellors, Directors, and Registrars of the Govt's Higher Education Institutes are directly under the supervision of the Chancellor, i.e. the President of India. But, many of them who are still under the Govt's payrolls have declared their institute as a non-Central Govt Entity, and as "Autonomous." 

In this manner, by shamelessly and cunningly usurping sovereignty above the Central Govt's affairs, those executive officers of various and several Govt institutes have abused their "discretionary powers" for deliberately circumventing legislative controls and audits, in a belligerent act of treason and usurpation. 

As such, a pattern of corrupt behaviour openly exists among India's several Central Universities and Govt's Higher Education Institutes. This is mainly due to the intentional abuse of official powers by the executives of those Central Govt Entities, in abject violation of established laws and ordinances. 

Due to this type of rampant corruption, executive officers of University of Hyderabad (i.e. Hyderabad Central University, HCU) cunningly "auctioned and sold" hundreds of acres of public lands by destroying ecologically sensitive forests and wetlands. They did so, by willfully and knowingly entering into shady deals with private buyers, through the aid of State Govt bureaucrats who were an accessory to such organized crimes. Similar shady deals currently exist between HCU and healthcare organizations in Telangana. 

So, are institutes like Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and HCU, a private corporate entity? No. Do they or their campuses belong to the Telangana State Govt? No. Are they a non-government organization? No. 

>[!IMPORTANT]  
>Do entities like HCU, CSIR, and Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO) exist because of a Central Govt legislative Act? Yes. Do they function primarily on public money from Govt of India? Yes. Do they file annual reports to the Rajya Sabha? Yes. Are they an agent of The State? Yes. So how are they not a Central Govt Entity? 
>
>**They most certainly are a Central Govt Entity, and so are all Public Sector Units (PSUs) such as State Bank of India (SBI), Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) and Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL). This is a fact that cannot be denied or further belaboured.**  
>
>Now, supposedly, organizations such as India's Central Universities and PSUs like HAL are "Autonomous Institutes" or "Semi-Autonomous Entities." But their so-called autonomy doesn't grant them any authority or powers that are independent of The Republic's laws, that too, while deriving legitimacy and funding from the Central Govt!

Also, "CGHS/ECHS Empanelled Healthcare Organizations" are accredited and heavily subsidized by The State, due to which, the managers and medical practitioners of those healthcare organizations have already been prepaid in good-faith via tax-payer money, along with a fair profit margin for their healthcare goods and services rendered as per CGHS/ECHS.

And yet, many healthcare organizations in India, while continuously maintaining their "CGHS/ECHS Empanellment" for receiving annual Govt subsidies (public monies), dishonestly claim that their staff and contractors go unpaid or underpaid, for rendering goods and services through CGHS/ECHS. Furthermore, numerous conniving staff and managers belonging to accredited hospitals in India, circumvent CGHS/ECHS norms by claiming that, one or the other medical goods or services are not covered under the government scheme, when in fact those items are clearly listed in published government orders. 

Bad actors among healthcare organizations and colluding executives from so-called Autonomous Institutes are exploitatively taking undue advantage of the fact that, a majority of Central Govt members who are rightly entitled to CGHS/ECHS are unaware of relevant government orders and scheduled lists published within obscure parts of government websites, especially when that vital and relevant information is simply never displayed saliently in hospital websites and in their buildings where patients can learn about their rights. 

This profound failure in proper governance and administration of public funds and utilities, is still ongoing, mainly because mafia organization have taken root within the Healthcare and Pharmaceutical Industry sectors of many states in India. Worst of all, despite clear and open evidence of such publicly visible wrongdoings, policing agencies are hesitant, reluctant, or downright adamant about not taking full and appropriate legal actions against those identified wrongdoers, primarily because of complacency, incompetence, impotence, cowardice, and corruption that has become prevalent among particular groups of police officers. 

So, would law enforcement agencies such as the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) have the necessary resources, to mitigate or counteract advanced persistent threats from cyber-attacks and drone based attacks on police stations, courthouses, hospitals and other critical infrastructure in India? How will they, especially when they never received those crucial resources from Research and Development (R&D) institutes, particularly because workers in those government institutes, including those in CRPF and NIA along with their family members, are still being put under inordinate stresses and strain, and are also being thrust into jeopardy, from being habitually cheated by accredited and subsidized "CGHS/ECHS Empanelled Healthcare Organizations" like Quality Care India Ltd (i.e. Care Hospitals). 

No doubt, too many bad bureaucrats and public servants have been colluding with corporate healthcare organizations for profiteering at the expense of public good and public safety. Their lawful and necessary punishments for curtailing and deterring the culpable activities of profiteering and racketeering are long-overdue.
