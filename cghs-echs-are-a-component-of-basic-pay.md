## CGHS & ECHS are Rightfully a Component of Central Government's Basic-Pay

In fact, Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) and Ex-Servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS) <u>are not</u> "privileges" or "perks" offered to Central Govt workers and retirees in India, as those health insurance and basic benefits are a vital component of their taxable income, basic-pay, wages, salaries, pensions, and emoluments. 

As per the statue of *State Employees' Insurance Act, 1948,* Govt workers and retirees of postal, police, fire, defense, health, education, forestry, sports, and administrative departments have a mandatory requirement to be insured by The State's corporation for healthcare insurance, i.e. corporations such as CGHS and ECHS. Such category of current and ex-members of the Central Govt of India also include particular journalists, freedom fighters, and scholars. The basic compensations of those workers and pensioners via government's payroll services aren't a "perk" to be stolen or eroded by the whims of bad bureaucrats. 

>[!NOTE]  
>Especially with respect to *Section 1(4) of State Employees' Insurance Act, 1948,* that has been in effect since 1989, within all states and union territories of The Republic of India:
>
>The "healthcare expense reimbursement programs" being operated by various establishments belonging to or controlled via majority share holding by The State, are significantly dissimilar and largely deficient compared to the "cashless transactions" and nation-wide benefits of CGHS/ECHS. 
>
>For example, members of State Bank of India (SBI) are being forced to endure "cash-flow risks" and are being deprived of the opportunity to build Credit History, from having to use the healthcare expense reimbursement program of the said Public Sector Unit (PSU). As such, SBI's healthcare expense reimbursement program is *neither substantially similar nor superior to CGHS.* This is particularly because unlike the healthcare expense reimbursement programs of SBI and University of Hyderabad, "CGHS is modern and cashless based on a CGHS Card with an electronic chip for fraud prevention, which is usable throughout India for each cadre of Govt workers and pensioners."  

Additionally, in the context of public institutes, it must be observed that: Vice Chancellors, Directors, and Registrars of the Govt's Higher Education Institutes are directly under the supervision of the Chancellor, i.e. the President of India. But, many of them who are still under the Govt's payrolls have declared their institute as a non-Central Govt Entity, and as "Autonomous." 

In this manner, by cunningly usurping sovereignty over the Central Govt's affairs, those executive officers of various and several Govt institutes have abused their "discretionary powers" for deliberately circumventing legislative controls and audits, in a belligerent act of treason and usurpation.

### Update:

Whether this issue can be resolved via the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) is in-itself a legal conundrum because the CAT can only be approached for issues pertaining to appointments of Indian Administrative Service officers and for service related grievances of existing Central Government Entities such as the University Grants Commission (UGC). However, the UGC does not service the healthcare insurance or the medical expense reimbursements of retirees and pensioners belonging to Central Universities in India. Additionally, none of the Central Universities are listed within the [*List of Corporations / Societies / Other Authorities that are Within The Purview of CAT, Under Section 14(2) of The Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985.*](https://github.com/just-noticeable/damroo/blob/main/ki-saaz/14-india_law-central_administrative_tribunals-jurisdiction.pdf)   


See if you can find the obvious contradiction in the statements provided by University of Hyderabad's executive officers: 

1. When the officers of University of Hyderabad, such as the Vice Chancellor's and the Registrar's staff along with the Assistant Registrar of the university's Finance Department are asked about, how and why did they take on the role of administering CGHS for the said university's current and ex-members, those officers claim that they have had "autonomy" to do so, and because the University of Hyderabad is not a Central Government Entity as it is an "Autonomous Body" under the UGC. 

1. So when they are asked, "Isn't your choice to substitute the actual CGHS with the university's Medical Expense Reimbursement program, a willful and forceful action that encroaches upon the roles and responsibilities of the Director General of CGHS?" They answer, "We are operating the University of Hyderabad's Medical Bills / Expense Reimbursement program, as per the *'Central Civil Service, Classification, Control and Appeal Rules of 1965,'* that govern the Central Government of India's public services and civil servants. 

The legal definition and scope of "Autonomous Body/Entity" under the UGC have never been defined by any legislative act. That title of "Autonomous Body/Entity" given to any Central University is redundant and useless, because executive officers of each Central University under the UGC are any ways authorized to conduct regular business of their educational institute as per the "object of the university" as defined in *the Central Universities Act, 2009.* The phrase, "object of the university" in that statute means, objectives of the university. Other legislative acts in India such as *the University of Hyderabad Act, 1974,* are identical in their wording and purpose to *the Central Universities Act, 2009.*  

As a matter of fact, University of Hyderabad is a Central Government Entity, and all of its current as well as ex-members have always been eligible for CGHS by virtue of being current or ex-members of the Central Govt of India. Furthermore, **the healthcare insurance for The State's employees and pensioners** is a "mandatory spending" budgeted by the Central Government of India via its corporations such as CGHS and ECHS, as it is not a "discretionary spending" in view of the laws in force. The State's corporations such as CGHS and ECHS are funded annually via tax-payer monies. 

So it must be noted that: Obstructing or modifying the Civil Rights of citizens in any manner, is certainly not within the ambit of the discretionary powers vested in the officers of Central Universities in India.

As such, a pattern of corrupt behaviour openly exists among India's several Central Universities and Govt's Higher Education Institutes, particularly with respect to health insurance via CGHS for current and ex-members of those institutes. This has been occurring mainly due to the intentional abuse of official powers by the executives of those Central Govt Entities, in abject violation of established laws and ordinances. 

Due to this type of rampant corruption, executive officers of University of Hyderabad cunningly and arrogantly "auctioned and sold" hundreds of acres of public lands in April-2025 upon destroying ecologically sensitive forests and wetlands. They did so while proclaiming autonomy, by willfully and knowingly entering into shady deals with private buyers, through the aid of State Govt bureaucrats who were an accessory to such organized crimes. Similar shady deals currently exist between University of Hyderabad (i.e. Hyderabad Central University, HCU) and healthcare organizations in Telangana. 

The Legislative Assembly and Judiciary Courts in India must observe that an Army Chief of Staff cannot arbitrarily remove a platoon or any other unit of the military from ECHS, by claiming autonomy to do so. Similarly, executive officers of publicly funded "Autonomous Institutes" cannot arbitrarily remove their institute from CGHS, specifically because there has never been an explicitly stated provision to do so, in any legislative Act that governs those institutes. 

Likewise, Govt pleaders and advocates must note: *"The faults and deficiencies within healthcare benefits programs arising due to non-uniform private deals transacted by PSUs and Public Institutes, with healthcare organizations, for reimbursement of healthcare expenses to The State's employees and pensioners."* They should also take note of the yearly wastage of public money, and the encroachment upon the roles and responsibilities of the Director Generals of CGHS and ECHS, that is being committed by executive officers of PSUs and Public Institutes through irregular and non-uniform employee benefits programs.

Each of the so-called employee benefits programs that Govt Entities like Central Universities are operating, particularly by using the ruse of having autonomy, are highly irregular, discriminatory, and utterly arbitrary in how the members of those institutes are serviced by privately contracted healthcare organizations for discounted treatments or for "CGHS rates and tariffs", upon submitting a Medical Reimbursement Claim to the institute's officers. 

**More importantly:** What type of inducements did the executive officers of various Central Govt Organizations have, for removing their respective organizations from CGHS, only to then enter into private deals with corporate hospitals and clinics, for obtaining healthcare treatments at irregular discounts or *at outdated CGHS rates and tariffs?* Did they receive bribes and gifts from those corporate healthcare providers to push salary or pension earners, into the fangs of wolfs, especially those predatory wolfs who are disguised as managers of hospitals and private insurers?  

As such, are institutes like Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and HCU, a private corporate entity? No. Do they or their campuses belong to the Telangana State Govt? No. Are they a non-government organization? No.

<br>

>[!IMPORTANT]  
>Do entities like HCU, CSIR, and Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO) exist because of a Central Govt Legislative Act? Yes. Do they function primarily on public money from Govt of India? Yes. Do they file annual reports to the Rajya Sabha? Yes. Are they an agent of The State? Yes. So how are they not a Central Govt Entity? 
>
>They most certainly are a Central Govt Entity, and so are all Public Sector Units (PSUs) such as State Bank of India (SBI), Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) and Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL). This is a fact that cannot be denied or further belaboured.  
>
>Now, supposedly, organizations such as India's Central Universities and PSUs like HAL are "Autonomous Institutes" or "Semi-Autonomous Enterprises." But their so-called autonomy doesn't grant their officers any authority or powers that are independent of The Republic's laws, that too, while deriving legitimacy and funding from the Central Govt!

<br>

Also, "CGHS/ECHS Empanelled Healthcare Organizations" are accredited and heavily subsidized by The State, due to which, the managers and medical practitioners of those healthcare organizations have already been prepaid in good-faith via tax-payer money, along with a fair profit margin for their healthcare goods and services rendered as per CGHS/ECHS.

And yet, many healthcare organizations in India, while continuously maintaining their "CGHS/ECHS Empanellment" for receiving annual Govt subsidies (public monies), dishonestly claim that their staff and contractors go unpaid or underpaid, for rendering goods and services through CGHS/ECHS. Furthermore, numerous conniving staff and managers belonging to accredited hospitals in India, circumvent CGHS/ECHS norms by claiming that, one or the other medical goods or services are not covered under the said government scheme, when in fact those items are clearly listed in published government orders. 

In a criminally exploitative way, bad actors among healthcare organizations and colluding executives from so-called Autonomous Institutes are taking undue advantage of the fact that, a majority of Central Govt members who are rightly entitled to CGHS/ECHS are unaware of relevant government orders and scheduled lists published within obscure parts of government websites, especially when that vital and relevant information is simply never displayed saliently in hospital websites and in their buildings where patients can learn about their rights. 

This profound failure in proper governance and administration of public funds and utilities, is still ongoing, mainly because mafia organizations have taken root within the Healthcare and Pharmaceutical Industry sectors of many states in India. Worst of all, despite clear and open evidence of such publicly visible wrongdoings, policing agencies are hesitant, reluctant, or downright adamant about not taking full and appropriate legal actions against those identified wrongdoers, primarily because of complacency, incompetence, impotence, cowardice, and corruption that has become prevalent among particular groups of police officers. 

By causing mortal wounds and long-term harms to vulnerable patients who are lured to certain healthcare organizations using the ruse of CGHS or ECHS, groups of unethical medical practitioners deliberately make the victims more prone and susceptible to being exploited. This type of predatory crime is being perpetrated against lured victims through the forced compulsion of having to repeatedly visit the hospital or clinic, for costly follow ups and treatments at the hands of the healthcare organization's bad medical practitioners. The medically induced wounds inflicted upon the victims causes them to become more vulnerable due to a loss of vitality and well being, leading towards slow and painful death. 

An example of this type of medically induced harm being caused by identified cardiologists and electro-physiologists is to deliberately deactivate the safety features within an implanted pacemaker, to slowly overload the patient's heart rate with continuous pacing which causes internal and hidden injuries to the vulnerable patient's physiology. Additionally, by improperly documenting or simply not documenting the pacemaker's prescribed settings in the patient's medical records, the root cause of the patient's improperly functioning pacemaker remains hidden and masked from other physicians. Another example of a medical malpractice is that of extremely zealous oncologists who do not prioritize minimally invasive surgical procedures, and who intentionally overdose patients with Chemo and Radiation therapy by causing maximum harm to the patient while using the excuse of needing to save the patient's life from "cancer." 

All these types of harms and injuries caused by medically induced procedures that are cunningly projected as "necessary" and "medically sound" are in fact wrongful and surreptitious. The selectively targeted and victimized patient is pushed towards fatality while being exploited financially by the culpable healthcare organization's staff, and the increasing range of harms done to the patient are masked as "comorbidity due to aging or medical complications." 

In this manner, a series of medically induced yet clandestine harms are being done to innocent patients by maleficent bad-actors who are abusing their social stature and title of being healthcare professionals. This is how the targeted victims lured from Central Government entities like University of Hyderabad are being exploited and preyed upon in a parasitic and cunning way, by the dangerous and nefarious nexus of professionals from a particular group of healthcare organizations. The identifying characteristic of those harmful medical professionals is the fact that their healthcare organizations are privately and illegally linked with the University of Hyderabad, for providing CGHS rates to the said Central University's employees and retirees.

So, would law enforcement agencies such as the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) have the necessary resources, to mitigate or counteract advanced persistent threats from cyber-attacks and drone based attacks on police stations, courthouses, hospitals and other critical infrastructure in India? How will they, especially when they never received those crucial resources from Research and Development (R&D) institutes, particularly because workers in those government institutes, including those in CRPF and NIA along with their family members, are still being put under inordinate stresses and strain, and are also being thrust into jeopardy, from being habitually cheated by accredited and subsidized "CGHS/ECHS Empanelled Healthcare Organizations" like Quality Care India Ltd (i.e. Care Hospitals). 

Given the reality of the ongoing and large-scale nature of such organized crimes in the Indian healthcare industry, the language and tone in this article cannot be "dialed down" to dilute it, or to make it sound more "polite." These types of crimes would normally shock the conscience of any sensible human being, if it were not for the currently hidden and understated attributes of these types of violations and offences, in the Public's Eye. 

No doubt, too many bad bureaucrats and public servants have been colluding with corporate healthcare organizations for profiteering at the expense of public good and public safety. Lawful and necessary punishments for curtailing and deterring their culpable activities of profiteering and racketeering are long-overdue.
