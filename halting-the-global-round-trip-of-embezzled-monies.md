## Halting The Global Round Trip of Embezzled Monies

So, when money stolen from the public by various entities, ends up in off-shore accounts, it then usually has to come back to those entities in their native country after being laundered, so that each criminal entity within a network of co-conspirators can convert that laundered capital into socio-political influence.  

Let's continue our [discussion from earlier](https://github.com/callthis/fiction/blob/master/when_might_the_international_bureau_get_involved.md), about the corporate bosses of particular Hospitals in Hyderabad, Telangana, India, that had their corporation's general meeting on 23rd September, 2024. Those bosses, who will need to bring back the money they stole from the public, back to India, from the off-shore accounts they had stashed their ill-gotten gains. They will need boat loads of cash, for paying their back-taxes to the Central Government of India, and for paying off various government officials to reduce the back-taxes owed to the Central Government. Those crooked corporate bosses are likely to use a mechanism such as: 

1. Using the money in their off-shore accounts to purchase commercial or residential real estate in various foreign countries via shell corporations.  

1. Use the sales deeds of fixed assets purchased with dark money as a collateral, for getting legitimate business loans and lines of credit from retail banks. 

1. Pay off "business expenses" such as back-taxes, penalties, fines, lawyers, fixers, corrupt officials, and disgruntled employees, as well as pain-in-the-neck consumers wielding a lawsuit using the clean money from the bank loans and credit accounts.
