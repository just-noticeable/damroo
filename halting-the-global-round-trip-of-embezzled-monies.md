## Halting The Global Round Trip of Embezzled Monies

So, when money stolen from the public by various entities, ends up in off-shore accounts, it then usually has to come back to those entities in their native country after being laundered, so that each criminal entity within a network of co-conspirators can convert that laundered capital into socio-political influence.  

Let's continue our [discussion from earlier](https://github.com/callthis/fiction/blob/master/when_might_the_international_bureau_get_involved.md), about the corporate bosses of particular hospitals in Hyderabad, Telangana, India, that had their corporation's general meeting on 23rd September, 2024. Those bosses, will soon need to bring back the money they stole from the public, back to India, from the off-shore accounts where they have stashed their ill-gotten gains. They will need boat-loads of cash, from their on-shore hidden accounts as well the off-shore ones, for paying their back-taxes to the Central Government of India, and for paying off various government officials to reduce the amount of those back-taxes and penalties owed to the Central and State Governments. Those crooked corporate bosses are likely to use a mechanism such as: 

1. With the money in "various and several" on-shore and off-shore accounts, purchase commercial or residential real estate, gold, diamonds, gems, as well as *futures contracts* and corporate currencies in numerous local and foreign locations, via shell corporations and "consulting companies."  

1. Then, use the sales deeds of fixed as well as more easily fungible assets purchased with dark money and shady deals, for getting legitimate business loans and lines of credit from multi-national retail banks and "start-ups", in India. 

1. Using the clean money from the bank loans, business loans, and credit accounts, pay off "business expenses" such as back-taxes, penalties, fines, legal fees for lawyers and consultants, somewhat legal fees for fixers, straight up bribes and gifts to corrupt officials, and appeasement money to disgruntled employees and investors, as well as pain-in-the-neck remedy to any Consumers wielding a lawsuit.  

1. Next, sell the various and several fungible assets held as collateral at banks, to gullible buyers in the open market for a sizable profit, and pay the capital-gains tax on that profit (very neatly and cleanly), to then take the retained earnings from those sales to show to legitimate investors that the "healthcare" company they have invested in, is doing very well, despite having paid penalties for all sorts of professional misconduct and corporate malfeasance.  

Now, much more importantly, the particular corrupt hospitals, in Hyderabad, Telangana, India, have a concept called **Average Return per Patient (ARP)** in their business plans and financial models. The ARP within Southern, Western, and Northern cities of India for healthcare based revenues is much greater than that in Eastern cities. This is mainly because of consumer behaviour phenomena in those cities which, have more educated and affluent residents relative to India's demographics in the Eastern states. However, the most profitable ARP is from Central Government employees and retirees in any given city of India. Those types of consumers who are, or were, employed by the Central Government, happen to have the most precisely verifiable employment and salary history, along with the most reliable credit history that is either good or excellent, and those people also happen to be extremely "risk-averse" while being "fashion-forward", "savings-oriented", and "health-conscious." 

Those people, including ex-servicemen from the Central Government's armed forces, are the ideal targets for scams and shady tactics that include jacking up the ARP so that, if a local citizen pays a lower amount for a few healthcare expenses at a private hospital, then the Central Government employees and retirees are overcharged using hidden costs and surcharges to maintain the hospital's monthly and yearly ARP. And that surcharged healthcare cost for those ideal targets of the scam, is any ways picked up by the Central Government which, invariably pays the corporate hospitals in cash, in tax incentives, as well as in credit. Paying off various officials in Central Government's **"healthcare cost reimbursement programs",** to overlook or to turn a blind-eye for thefts bellow Rs 5,00,000 (Rupees Five Lakhs) per business transaction, is rather convenient. The bribes happen to include "recommendation letters" to the children and family members of those corrupt officials for admissions into colleges, universities, and medical schools, and for secure employment in various private sector jobs. 

In the context of such country-wide scams involving government-backed programs, what exactly are retired university professors and ex-servicemen going to do against corporate bosses with deep-pockets and their posh lawyers? Fight? Using what kind of gear, tools, equipment, training, resources, strategies, and tactics? 

Especially when those ex-servicemen are given the fable that their healthcare expenses are "free", what further arguments can *they and their families* pose against an army of corporate lawyers from international ivy-league colleges? 

There is no such thing as a "free lunch" in this universe, there is absolutely no such thing as a free healthcare program for hundreds of thousands of soldiers in any country. All healthcare costs of those so-called free treatments in private hospitals is pre-paid, via taxes and other forms of annuities deducted from salaries and pensions that keep accruing interests. The credit accumulated by each individual who is entitled to quality healthcare treatments in private hospitals at a regularized cost that makes sense, to the care-provider and the care-recipient, is simply unaccounted and currently unaccountable. 

Government subsidy programs for healthcare costs in India, especially the ones known as Ex-servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS) and the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS), are unregulated healthcare insurance companies that provide insurance guarantee as well as credit, to the Consumers of healthcare products and services, via selected retail channels and private corporate partners of the Central Government called, *"ECHS or CGHS Empanelled Hospitals."*  

Worst of all, there are CGHS-like programs that are simply a sham version of the unregulated insurance companies called ECHS and CGHS, currently being operated by every other ministry of the Government of India, by using a direct line-of-credit from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The more inefficient or corrupt the workers in those sham insurance companies happen to be, the more amount of interest on unpaid benefits to innocent Consumers is raked in, by those sham healthcare insurance companies being operated by the Government of India. This may sound harsh and like a "low-blow" to many onlookers in the Indian Government, but there isn't a way to sugarcoat this anymore. 

Now, this is how a person like me can end up getting arrested by the Central or State Government's authorities, for charges of "defamation" or for spreading "misinformation and conspiracy theories" or for some other ginned up allegations, instead of the numerous corrupt officials and private corporate bosses who are grievously injuring hardworking communities and societies in India. However, if I get arrested and put away, then which one of those officials and corporate bosses will go hunt down submarines and nuclear warheads of enemy nations, and that too, for the sake of art? 

Any ways, I am sure that there will be somebody else who can do whatever it is that I do, or am supposed to be able to do, for one or the other "patriotic group" of our Asiatic diaspora.  

In the mean time, let me now explain why I've bothered to write these types of things openly, though it can be estimated that almost no persons in the world will ever read through any of these long-form blog articles.  

- Foundational flaws within financial systems of a country are ripe for exploitation by international agencies acting as "short-sellers" within markets for shares, debentures, bonds, and securities. Agencies like BlackRock and Hindenburg Research from the USA have a simple philosophy, about being or becoming the apex predator, in the global arena for mercantile trades and economics, by preying upon weaker financial institutions or businesses. The harms and damages that can be done to a country by those types of agencies, is far greater than the so-called embarrassment a government official can feel for being exposed for their incompetence or corruption. 

- Zero-day faults within financial systems of a country are the types of vulnerabilities that get exploited via zero-day attacks launched by cut-throat entities like Hindenburg Research, because it generates the greatest amount of profit for them, in a global zero-sum-game for financial resources. The only way for government officials in countries like India, where each of the Chebol of families like the Adani and the Ambani have gotten out of hand, is to get in front and ahead of, the public relations issues pertaining to zero-day faults within national systems. Those zero-day faults within national banking and insurance systems will take months or years to repair after they are acknowledged by grim-faced government officials, but the millions of cyber-attacks per day by short-sellers attempting to take undue advantage of those faults will only take nano or micro seconds per attack. Those attackers simply think of themselves as "threshers" who are getting rid of the **["chaff."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaff)** So, according to them, they are not taking "undue" advantages of anything or anyone, they are only taking "rightful" advantages of nature's rules. 

- Am I the first one to discover the flaws and dysfunctions of ECHS, CGHS, and other such unregulated **"cash advance" programs** of the Indian Government for healthcare costs that directly impact more than 3.5 Crore (35 Million) people in India? No, I usually learn about things five to six weeks after analysts in BlackRock and Hindenburg Research learn about those kinds of things, from their online and on-ground chatter. The only way I am different from them is that I believe in the philosophy that a greater being within nature, is more like a *Banyan Tree,* which peacefully provides protection and sustenance to other beings in the "wilderness", so as to improve the lives of all those beings in a symbiotic way. There is absolutely no genuine need for conscientious human beings to behave like a ruinous predator or a molester or a rapist or a plunderer or a parasite, especially against humanity. 

- The best that the Government of India can do to protect Indian citizens, at this late stage of incoming cyber-attacks in the form of "algorithmic trades" and "naive market movements" instigated from and by, certain international agencies, is to brace for impact and then mitigate the consequent public relations fallout. 

As such, this article and opinion piece, is mainly for organizations like Central Economic Intelligence Bureau (CEIB) of India, so that conscientious officers in those types of bureaus can halt the round-trip journey of embezzled monies that have been benefiting a nexus of nefarious hospitals and certain corrupt officials from Central and State Government Employers in India, via private financial institutions such as Axis Bank and Yes Bank.  

Those banks will plead innocence and "complete lack of awareness" of how various mechanisms of money laundering are being routed through them by particular mafia bosses of <ins>certain</ins> corporate hospitals in India. They will claim that they have and are doing the best they can, for cooperating with law enforcement agencies and directives in India, to improve credibility, safety, security, and transparency of supplying liquidity to customers within the Asian Subcontinent's financial markets. And most probably, filing charges against those bank employees, or doing anything, to arrest them will be futile and practically impossible because they are as clever as, if not more than the upper management of Morgan Stanley and HSBC Bank. 

However, I do believe, that business insurance providers such as Lloyds Company of London, are about to drop particular hospitals in India as clients, and those insurance underwriters are going to *refrain* from picking up any other corporate hospitals as clients: 

- that magically have, nearly 100% healthy "Accounts Receivables", 

- or ones that do not have, a proper invoicing mechanism for payments from healthcare Consumers.
